Database notes
Chosing PostgreSQL GUI client. 
'pgAdmin' is great for its feature-richness. However, I found its UI is clumsy and complicated. So I've desided to use PSequel instesd. P.S. For some reason PSequel do not work with latest version of PostgreSQL. So, we're going to use pgAdmin4.
Unlike in pgAdmin3, with pgAdmin4, here you have to manually connect to a running postgres server. So, when you entering it there gonna be no DB under "Servers" root folder (it's going to be completely empty).
